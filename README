The following code for this repository is the Java-files used for the test results in this thesis:


Sorting Tests:

- Quicksort (QuicksortTesting.java): Sequential, Threaded, ExecutorService and Fork/Join implementations tested with Test Data Structure seen in Section 3.1.
- LSD-Radixsort (LSDRadixsortTesting.java): Sequential and three Parallel implementations using CyclicBarrier and Atomicity, tested with Test Data Structure seen in Section 3.1.
- Graph Creation (GraphCreationSort.java): Create graph from the data produced by QuicksortTesting.java and LSDRadixsortTesting.java.

Overhead Tests:
- Overhead (OverheadTesting.java): Methods, Classes, Threads, ExecutorService and Fork/Join overhead testing.
- OverheadAtomic (OverheadAtomicTesting.java): int, int[], AtomicInteger, AtomicIntegerArray overhead testing.
- Batch-file for Overhead (OverheadTesting.bat): Test the Overhead and/or OverheadAtomic many times in a Windows environment.
- Bash-file for Overhead (OverheadTesting.sh): Test the Overhead and/or OverheadAtomic many times in a Linux environment.
- Graph Creation (GraphCreationOverhead.java): Create graph from the data produced by OverheadTesting.java and OverheadAtomicTesting.java.
